    "# RDF Vocabulary: Collections\n",

    "# Graph Modeling with OWL 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, we used RDF Schema to write simple ontologies. These ontologies have the advantage that there are only a few rules, which makes an automated inference relatively efficient. But RDF Schema has very limited expressivity. For example we can't express that a class can only have a certain cardinality of a specific property or that a class is the intersection of two other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Web Ontology Language (OWL)** is an ontology language like RDFS but can be used to model more complex concepts. OWL allows us to formulate expressions from **description logic** directly in RDF. As in RDFS, OWL defines three components: Individuals/Objects (concrete elements), Classes/Concepts (sets of objects) and Roles/Properties (which associate two individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most properties defined in the RDFS vocabulary can also be used when writing an ontology using OWL. For example **rdfs:subClassOf**, **rdfs:subPropertyOf**, **rdfs:range** and **rdfs:domain** can all be used together with OWL and have the same semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on certain topics please consult the [OWL 2 Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/). In [Section 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#OWL_Syntaxes) you can change the syntax of the examples to turtle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "While **rdf:type** is used RDFS to declare that a resource belongs to a class, **owl:Class** is used in OWL2, which is the class of all classes. For example, to declare that a resource is a class, one can use the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Professor a owl:Class .**\n",
    "\n",
    "**owl:Thing** is the class of everything (similar to rdfs:Resource) and **owl:Nothing** is the empty class. Both are predefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "OWL distinguishes between abstract roles, which are properties with resources as range, and concrete roles, which have a data type as range. The class of all abstract roles is **owl:ObjectProperty** and the class of all concrete roles is **owl:DatatypeProperty**. An example for both types of roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:belongsTo a owl:ObjectProperty ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rdfs:range ex:Organisation .  \n",
    "ex:firstName a owl:DatatypeProperty ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rdfs:range xsd:String .  \n",
    "ex:ProfDecker ex:belongsTo ex:I5 .  \n",
    "ex:ProfDecker ex:firstName \"Stefan\" .**\n",
    "\n",
    "ex:belongsTo is an abstract role because it has the class ex:Organisation as range. ex:firstName is a concrete role as it has datatype xsd:String as range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "As in RDFS, we can use **rdfs:subClassOf** to define class hierarchies. To specify that two classes are equivalent (contain the same individuals), OWL defines the property **owl:equivalentClass**. To define that the classes ex:Dog and ex:Dogs are equivalent, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Dog owl:equivalentClass ex:Dogs .**\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify that two classes are disjoint (an individual from one class cannot belong to the other class), OWL defines the property **owl:disjointWith**. To define that the classes ex:Dog and ex:Cat are disjoint, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Dog owl:disjointWith ex:Cat .**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another notation to easily specify pairwise disjointness of more than two classes. For this one uses the class **owl:AllDisjointClasses**, the property **owl:members** and a collection of classes in a blank node. To specify that ex:Dog, ex:Cat and ex:Horse are pairwise disjoint, one would add the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses;  \n",
    "owl:members ( ex:Dog ex:Cat ex:Horse ) \\] .**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogous to classes, we can define property hierarchies with **rdfs:subPropertyOf**, equivalent properties with **owl:equivalentProperty** and disjoint properties with **owl:propertyDisjointWith** (or **owl:AllDisjointProperties** and **owl:member**).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also specify that a property is the inverse of another property with **owl:inverseOf**. To define that ex:owns is the inverse of ex:ownedBy, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:own owl:inverseOf ex:ownedBy .**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In OWL there are also many classes to assign certain characteristics to properties. For example, to define that the property ex:knows is reflexive (everybody knows himself), one would use the class **owl:ReflexiveProperty**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:knows a owl:ReflexiveProperty .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of all property classes in OWL2:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reflexive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_ReflexiveObjectProperty): **owl:ReflexiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Irreflexive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_IrreflexiveObjectProperty): **owl:IrreflexiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Symmetric](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_SymmetricObjectProperty): **owl:SymmetricProperty**  \n",
    "[Asymmetric](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_AsymmetricObjectProperty): **owl:AsymmetricProperty**  \n",
    "[Transitive](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_TransitiveObjectProperty): **owl:TransitiveProperty**  \n",
    "[Functional](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_FunctionalObjectProperty): **owl:FunctionalProperty**  \n",
    "[Inverse Functional](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-primer-20121211/#a_InverseFunctionalObjectProperty): **owl:InverseFunctionalProperty**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Concrete roles (owl:DatatypeProperty) can at most be functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "OWL does not make the assumption that different URIs are automatically different individuals. For example, let's say we have the functional property ex:father (everyone can have at most one father -> functional) but we have the two triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Bart ex:father ex:Homer .  \n",
    "ex:Bart ex:father ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "A reasoner that makes the unique-names assumption, would declare this graph as inconsistent because the ex:father property was earlier defined as functional (owl:FunctionalProperty). But an OWL reasoner does not make this assumption and instead infers that ex:Homer and ex:HomerSimpson are two names for the same individual. For this, OWL has two assertion properties, **owl:sameAs** and **owl:differentFrom**. To assert that ex:Homer and ex:HomerSimpson are the same person, one would add the following triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Homer owl:sameAs ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, one would add the following triple to assert that ex:Homer (greek author) and ex:HomerSimpson (cartoon character) are not the same person:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Homer owl:differentFrom ex:HomerSimpson .**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with owl:AllDisjointClasses and owl:AllDisjointProperties, you can easily declare that multiple resources are pairwise different with **owl:AllDifferent** and **owl:member**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: owl:sameAs can be used on individuals and classes and means that two URIs are names for the same resource. owl:equivalentClass can only be used on classes and means that two classes contain the same individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Property Assertions\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of assertion in OWL are negative property assertions. These types of assertions can be used to assert that a triple does not hold. The syntax for this assertion is similar to the syntax of RDF reification and uses the class **owl:NegativePropertyAssertion** as well as the three properties **owl:sourceIndividual**, **owl:assertionProperty** and **owl:targetIndividual** in a blank node. For example, to assert that ex:Homer (greek author) is **not** the father of ex:Bart, one would add the following triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[ a owl:NegativePropertyAssertion;  \n",
    "owl:sourceIndividual ex:Bart;  \n",
    "owl:assertionProperty ex:father;  \n",
    "owl:targetIndividual ex:Homer \\].**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that positive property assertions are just facts (simple triples)."
