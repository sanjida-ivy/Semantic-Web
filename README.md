## Overview
The **Semantic Web** aims to make the web smarter by enabling machines to understand, interpret, and process data in a meaningful way. It achieves this by structuring data and defining relationships between different pieces of information. This allows systems to retrieve and connect relevant data more efficiently, improving tasks like search, automation, and personalized recommendations. By using technologies like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL, the Semantic Web transforms raw data into actionable knowledge.

### <span style="color:blue;">What is Data Modeling with OWL?</span>
Data Modeling with OWL (Web Ontology Language) is a way to organize and structure information so that machines can understand it. It helps define categories (like "Person" or "Car"), specific examples (like "Alice" or "Toyota"), and their relationships (like "Alice owns a Toyota"). OWL also allows setting rules, such as "Cars must have wheels," and enables systems to deduce new information from the data, making it easier to connect, share, and process knowledge across different systems.
