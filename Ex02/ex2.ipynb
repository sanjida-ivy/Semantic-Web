    "## Some useful theoretical concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turtle\n",
    "*Turtle* stands for **Terse RDF Triple Language** and a [W3C recommended](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) syntax. It is a file format for serializing RDF graphs. To serialize an RDF triple of the form *(Subject, Predicate, Object)* in Turtle, you just write them in that sequence, followed by a period. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Subject Predicate Object .**\n",
    "Please note the period after a triple. In turtle serialization, URIs are encased in angled brackets (&lt; &gt;). For example, the RDF triple *(http://example.org/#Germany, http://example.org/#capital, http://example.org/#Berlin)*  can be serialized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**&lt;http://example.org/#Germany&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#capital&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#Berlin&gt; .**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because of its very simple syntax, Turtle is intuitive and human-readable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntactic sugar:\n",
    "Because subjects or subject-predicate-combinations often repeat in the same graph, Turtle introduces some syntactic sugar.\n",
    "To repeat a subject, one can use a semicolon instead of a period after a triple. To express that Germany has the capital Berlin and the state Bavaria, one would write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**&lt;http://example.org/#Germany&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#capital&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#Berlin&gt; ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;http://example.org/#state&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#Bavaria&gt; .**\n",
    "\n",
    "To repeat a subject-predicate-combination, one can use a comma instead of a period after the triple. To express that Germany has the state Berlin and the state Bavaria, one would write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**&lt;http://example.org/#Germany&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#state&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#Berlin&gt; ,  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;http://example.org/#Bavaria&gt; .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these can be chained to repeat the same subject/subject-predicate-combination over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are allowed and even encouraged to use syntactic sugar throughout all our assignments.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### CURIEs\n",
    "Because we only used full URIs in 1a), the graph looks cluttered and both the graph and the turtle source are hard to read. But many URIs have the same prefix (http://example.org/sights for example) and turtle allows us to define abbreviations for these prefixes. These abbreviated URIs are called *Compact URIs* or *CURIES*. In Turtle, such a prefix is defined using the **@prefix** keyword, followed by the abbreviation, then the URI prefix in angled brackets (&lt; &gt;) and finally a period. For example, if we want to abbreviate *http://example.org/#* with *ex:*, then we need to prepend the following line to the turtle document:\n",
    "\n",
    "**@prefix ex: &lt;http://example.org/#&gt; .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can abbreviate the RDF triple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**&lt;http://example.org/#Germany&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#capital&gt; &lt;http://example.org/#Berlin&gt; .**\n",
    "\n",
    "to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Germany ex:capital ex:Berlin .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that we omit the angled brackets when using CURIEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "For basic values such as numbers and strings, it is impractical to use URIs. Instead of URIs we use literals. Literals have a data type, which is string by default. Literals can only be used in the object position of triples and are encased in double quotes (\" \"). An example for a triple with a string literal is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Germany ex:name \"Deutschland\" .**\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a *data type*, it is appended to the literal with *two carets* (^^). A data type can be an arbitrary URI, but there are some predefined data types which should suffice in most cases. These predefined data types use the prefix *http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#*, which is usually abbreviated with *xsd:*. An example for an integer literal:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Germany ex:population \"83042235\"^^xsd:int .**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also string literals with a specified language. This is useful for names that differ in different languages. To specify a language, we append a two character language tag with an at symbol (@) behind the literal. The literal is then automatically interpreted as a language tagged string (this data type is never specified explicitly). To express that ex:Germany has a different name in English and in German, one would add two triples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:Germany ex:name \"Deutschland\"@de .**  \n",
    "**ex:Germany ex:name \"Germany\"@en .**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the URI ex:Germany is **not** the same as the literal \"Germany\" and in some cases you can't deduce the name of an entity from the URI (for example www.wikidata.org uses numerical IDs, e.g https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blank Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes resources do not or should not have an identifier but still stand in relation to other resources. These anonymous resources are represented by blank nodes in RDF graphs. In Turtle, blank nodes are are represented with an underscore followed by a colon and an identifier (\\_:identifier). The purpose of the identifier is to be able to locally reference the anonymous resource multiple times. Even if two blank nodes in different graphs use the same identifier, they usually reference a different resource. For example, when you want to express that you know someone who is a professor but doesn't have an identifier and there is someone else you don't know who is also a professor, you do it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:me ex:knows \\_:1 .  \n",
    "\\_:1 rdf:type ex:professor .  \n",
    "\\_:2 rdf:type ex:professor .**\n",
    "\n",
    "You know \\_:1 but don't know \\_:2 but they are both professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, blank nodes are often used to represent n-ary relations. For example, a grading that needs to have a grade and a grader can be expressed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:student ex:grading \\_:1 .  \n",
    "\\_:1 ex:grade \"1.0\" .  \n",
    "\\_:1 ex:grader ex:professor .**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntactic sugar:**  \n",
    "To make this more readable, you can instead use square brackets (\\[ \\]) and every predicate-object-combination in between the square brackets will reference the same blank node. The grade example would then look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ex:student ex:grading \\[  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex:grade \"1.0\" ;  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex:grader ex:professor  \n",
    "\\] .**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we must use semicolons and commas in between the brackets (see syntactic sugar at top of assignment) and there is still a period after the brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also Note that the blank node identifier is exchangable as long as we use the same one when referencing the same node. That is why the bracket notation does not need an identifier."
